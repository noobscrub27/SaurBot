# SaurBot

Saurbot is a discord bot with the purpose of providing resources that may be helpful for the FnF Gaming discord server.
This github repository was created for transparency reasons (there are some shady bots out there), although it doesn't always reflect the most recent version of the code. However, whenever I make a major update, I update this repository.
Saurbot was primarily created as a convenient way to access noobscrub's FnF Showdown Search program, although since then it has gotten more features.
There are several major features that Saurbot provides:
- FnF Showdown Search, which is a filtering tool that allows users to filter data pertaining to FnF's Pokemon Showdown mod, FnF Showdown.
- A user profile system that allows server admins to assign users points, as well as other customizable options added at the request of FnF server members.
- There's also a few commands for Mario Kart players, such as a friend code tracker and a random character selecter.
WIP features that I want to add to the next update when I get the time:
- The replay analyzer. This is a program that reads FnF Showdown replay files and adds the results to a searchable database. This for the purpose of analyzing performance over time to inform balance decisions.
You're free to use this code for your own projects, although I'd appreciate credit where it's due. Please don't use this code for commercial purposes.
For questions and suggestions, don't be shy to contact noobscrub on discord!
