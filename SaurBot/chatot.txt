441-CHATOT: I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE HOW ANNOYING YOU MADE THIS BIRD. ERRATIC FLIGHT MEANS IT CAN U-TURN OUT OF A BAD MATCHUP AND LEAVE THE ENEMY CONFUSED FOR ITS TROUBLE. WITH ITS NEW SPEED AND SPECIAL ATTACK IT CAN SPAM BOOMBURST LIKE NOTHING ELSE, IT DOESN'T HAVE A GOOD PHYSICAL MOVE TO LEAD INTO A BOOSTED SCOLD, BUT THAT'S STILL A 100 BASE POWER DARK MOVE FOR A MON THAT'S AFRAID OF GHOSTS, YOU CAN ALREADY RUN CHATTER TO MAKE THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION ALL WHILE YOUR GHOST BUSTER GETS EVEN BETTER.
